TinyPedal LMU plugin (rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_Wine)

If you use Le Mans Ultimate, you can install the plugin manually from:
  https://github.com/schlegp/rF2SharedMemoryMapPlugin_Wine/tree/master/build

Copy the DLL into your Steam game install:
  ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Le Mans Ultimate/Plugins/

If your Steam library is elsewhere, adjust the path accordingly.

PySide6 launcher config (required for Archlinux)

You need to force PySide6, create:
  ~/.config/TinyPedal/launcher.conf

Add:
  TINYPEDAL_RUN_ARGS="--pyside 6"

One-liner:
  mkdir -p ~/.config/TinyPedal && printf 'TINYPEDAL_RUN_ARGS="--pyside 6"\n' > ~/.config/TinyPedal/launcher.conf
EOF
}
